5. Click **Extension** -> **Apps Script**
6. Paste the code in the **Code.js**
7. **Change important information** below:
- Name of the sheet containing your query
- The cell containing your query
- The final column number to clear data before displaying the result if you do not want to clear the whole sheet
- Name of the sheet that you want your data to be imported after running your query
8. Choose "**BigQuery API**" service in the **Services** section
9. Click "**Run**" to check if it can run successfully
10. If the code runs successfully, click "**Trigger**" to set up trigger events
11. **Select your options**:
  - For "selecting event source", choose "Time-driven" option
  - For "Select type of time based trigger", choose the frequency you desire to update your data
